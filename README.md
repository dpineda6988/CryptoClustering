# CryptoClustering

## Description
An analysis using unsupervised machine learning to predict if a set of different cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price.  This analysis creates and analyzes clusters using all features in the dataset (scaled) as well as through principal component analysis (PCA). 


### Dependencies
* Python (w/ jupyter notebook) and the following libraries/framworks
    * pandas
    * hvplot
    * sklearn
    * warnings
* The following .csv files are required (stored in the 'Resources' folder):
    * crypto_market_data.csv

### Installing & Execution
The repository files can be downloaded to open and execute the 'Crypto_Clustering.ipynb' file.  Note that since 'Crypto_Clustering.ipynb' contains relative file paths, it is important to maintain the file directory structure in order for it to execute properly.

CryptoClustering was created as an assignment for the University of California, Irvine Data Analytics Bootcamp - June 2024 Cohort under the instruction and guidance of Melissa Engle (Instructor) and Mitchell Stone (TA).
The practical exercises and coding examples demonstrated through the bootcamp helped inform and inspire the code for this project.
